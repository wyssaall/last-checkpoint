## Checkpoint Reflection
How ready I am to start a new step in my career path:

After completing the bootcamp, I feel much more confident and prepared to take the next step in my career. I now have a solid foundation in web development, particularly in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve also gained hands-on experience with frameworks and tools such as React and Git, which are essential in real-world projects. I'm ready to apply for internships or junior developer roles and start building real products with real users in mind.

This journey helped me discover not only the technical side of development but also how to approach challenges, communicate effectively in a team, and manage my time better. I still have more to learn, but I now have the mindset of a continuous learner—which I believe is one of the most important skills in tech.

## Thoughts on the skills I gained during the bootcamp:

The bootcamp helped me grow both technically and personally. Some of the key skills I gained include:

# Technical skills:
Responsive design, version control with Git/GitHub, JavaScript fundamentals, React basics, and working with APIs.

# Soft skills: 
Problem-solving, team collaboration, presenting my work, and giving/receiving feedback.

# Professional habits:
Following good coding practices, organizing projects, debugging, and learning to read documentation.

I also built multiple projects that reflect my progress and can be added to my portfolio, which gives me more confidence when applying to jobs or freelance opportunities.
